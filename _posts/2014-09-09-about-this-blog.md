### Intro
This blog is about a journey we want to share: we are building a new software product, learning day by day something new from our users, from our mistakes, from our friends.

### Why? (Quid pro quo)
No this blog is not a marketing effort, it's a giveback to the dev community; a giveback we hope can improve our learning journey through your feedback and maybe prevent you a headache for the same mistakes we made.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" ><p>Learn in the open. Have no shame to publish your code and ask questions and go after it.</p>&mdash; Kelly Sommers (@kellabyte) <a href="https://twitter.com/kellabyte/status/504105483569860608">August 26, 2014</a></blockquote>

ok.. show me the code.

### What
We plan to publish all the code with you (yes, the whole product.. not just code snippets) in 6-9 months when we hope to reach a full featured 1.0 release and have 500+ active paying users.

We'll share more about the product and the current stack (AngularJS, .Net, NEventstore, CQRS / ES / DDD, MongoDB, Elasticsearch) in the next weeks.

So.. No code? No party! Hold on... [software development is a learning process, working code is a side effetc](http://www.slideshare.net/ziobrando/model-storming)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" ><p>Stop thinking SW projects like building process, and start thinking Collaborative Learning Processes. Everything becomes clear. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/agile?src=hash">#agile</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ux?src=hash">#ux</a></p>&mdash; Alberto Brandolini (@ziobrando) <a href="https://twitter.com/ziobrando/status/507156257552470016">September 3, 2014</a></blockquote>

That's the point, we started this journey one year ago and we are pretty happy with this way of thinking / doing things.

We want to share what we have learned so far and what we'll learning in the next months (and yes.. some code too).

### Who
My name is Andrea [Andrea](/about/andreabalducci/), I run a small (4 devs) software house in Italy, in a place so beautiful to stop me from relocating abroad, and I'm very active in the local dev communities.

I failed twice at blogging, this is my 3rd try and the first one in English (well beyond my comfort zone).

I asked a close friend in the dev community to join us for the next months, we have a new customer and we need to scale up to 100x in terms of data and 4x in terms of active users (and a backlog with a lot of new interesting stuff).

Let me welcome on board [Gian Maria](/about/gianmariaricci/).

ALK INTRO


### Wrap-up
Me and Gian Maria we'll keep this blog up to date with our journey, and we hope to have guest posts from our friends sharing a similar path (and some code) on other projects.
Yes, we are looking at you [Stefano](https://twitter.com/ste8) and  [Alessandro](https://twitter.com/A_Giorgetti).

### Thanks to
- [Mauro Servienti](https://twitter.com/mauroservienti): inadvertently gave me the idea for the product name on our trip to [Frasassi caves](http://www.frasassi.com/);
- [Stefano Ottaviani](https://twitter.com/ste8): for choosing this project for his [graduation thesis](http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/ste8/archive/2014/03/03/pubblicazione-della-tesina-su-ddd-e-cqrs.aspx);
- [Andrea Saltarello](https://twitter.com/andysal74): Ubiquitous language, Ubiquitous language, Ubiquitous language!;
- [Alberto Brandolini](https://twitter.com/ziobrando): for introducing us to Evenstorming in the early stages and for sharing a [talk](http://www.slideshare.net/ziobrando/idea-postit-test-verdi) inspired by a subdomain of this project;
- [Alessandro Melchiori](https://twitter.com/amelchiori): the first talk about CQRS I've attended (as a powerpoint assistant.. "next slide please")... you owe me a beer;
- [Alessandro Giorgetti](https://twitter.com/A_Giorgetti): "DDD can't work! Angular? no, ko is fine". Now he's mastering DDD & AngularJs in the healthcare.

Our chats about aggregates, process managers, ubiquitous language, eventstorming, CQRS and Domain Driven Design are the building blocks of this journey.

A special mention goes to [Rinat Abdullin](https://twitter.com/abdullin) for inspiring this blog with his [Happypancake post](http://abdullin.com/long/happypancake/).
