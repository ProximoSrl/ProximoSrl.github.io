One year ago we started an "Intranet 2.0" project for a small bank.

## In the beginning there was Chaos
<blockquote>
And within this Chaos was Power,<br/>
Great Power without Form
</blockquote>

The project main goal was to improve the ease of access to key informations and
avoid custom (out of sync) document folders, with user's own taxonomy, on user's desktop.

So our first domain was a [DMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_management_system).

Others followed pretty soon:

* Support Ticketing with Knowledge Base,
* Corporate address book,
* Home Banking workflow,
* Point Of Sale workflow,
* Resource scheduling system,
* Corporate bookmarks,
* Corporate chat & file exchange,
* Active Directory sync,
* Analytics.

Some domains have been implemented with [CQRS](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html)+[ES](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html), others with CRUD.
In the next intro post I'll talk about the current architecture and dev stack.

Stay tuned!
