## What is
<blockquote>
Programmers should speak the language of domain experts to avoid
miscommunication, delays, and errors. To avoid mental translation between domain
language and code, design your software to use the language of the domain.
Reflect in code how users of the software think and speak about their work.
One powerful approach is to create a domain model.
<br/><br/>
The ubiquitous language is a living language. Domain experts influence design
and code and the issues discovered while coding influence domain experts.
When you discover discrepancies, it's an opportunity for conversation and joint
discovery. Then update your design to reflect the results.

## It's all about words?
Some time ago I had the pleasure to meet with some friends for our
[GUISA meeting](http://www.eventbrite.it/e/guisa-meeting-1-tickets-2972429617).

[Andrea Saltarello](https://twitter.com/andysal74) gave the
"Ubiquitous Language Smackdown" talk in which he shared his experience.
We made a very similar experience ourself (same terms, same communication issues
with our customer), but I was firmly convinced that this approach could be used
only on projects and was not suitable for products.

Based on our experience (we make products for ISV and very few projects,
mostly to kickoff new products) every client speaks it's own language;
it can depends on the market, the geographical location (event within the same
country), ...

-> domain expert -> domain is HIS domain not and Ubiquitous domain

## No it's all about meanings
